##  Project Overview

This project implements a fully serverless visitor tracking web application using AWS managed services.

The application architecture includes:

* Static frontend hosted on Amazon S3
* Global content delivery via CloudFront CDN
* REST API powered by API Gateway
* Backend logic using AWS Lambda
* Persistent storage using DynamoDB
* Automated deployment using GitHub Actions CI/CD

The system is highly scalable, cost-efficient, and requires zero server management.
